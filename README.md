# Random-Password-Generator

Random Password Generator is a tool that can be used to help you come up with a new password using the characters that you want to use!  Random Password Generator gives you the option to choose how long of a password you would like, if you want numbers in it, if you want lowercase letters in it, if you want uppercase letters in it and if you would like any special characters in it. It then takes the criteria that you provide and generates a random password that is perfect for your application.

## How it works

To get started, simply press the "Generate Password" button. The generator will then ask you how many characters you would like in your password.  After you have chosen how long your new password will be, simply choose if you would like numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase leters and special characters. You will then be given a unique password matching your unique style!
